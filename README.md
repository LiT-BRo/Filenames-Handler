<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiT-BRo/Filenames-Handler/main/Misc/Elements(v0.1).png" alt="Elements-Number-Labled" width="400"/>

## About
This is a fairly simple program with very simple instructions to follow. It's main purpose is to provide the user with a list of names of all files present in a directory with their extensions. It serves as a quick version control system as managing (Eg. downloaded) files can sometimes get very messy and can serve as a reference point of raw data which can further be processed  in which-ever way the user demands.

## Elements, buttons and functions

1) **Canvas:** *File names of the selected directory will appear here.*
2) **Open Folder Button:** *Will prompt with a Select Folder.*
3) **Run Button:** *Will execute the program and the text-file is exported to desktop.*
4) **Clear:** *Resets the queue of files and directories selected.*

## Instructions
- #### **Come on! Do you seriously need instructions for a program with 2 buttons. ^___^**
